I am a dedicated PhD student specializing in robotics at Lancaster University, with an anticipated graduation date in January 2024. Currently, I am actively engaged in research at the Advanced Robotic Teleoperation Lab, supported by a full studentship from a UKRI project funded by TWI Ltd and the [Lloyds Register Foundation](http://www.lrfoundation.org.uk/).

I hold a BEng degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering with Honours of the First Class from the University of Glasgow, as well as a BEng degree in Electronic Information Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, which I completed in 2020. He is an active member of the [Lancaster Intelligent Robots and Autonomous Systems Center (LIRA)](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lira/), the [Joining 4.0 Innovation Centre (J4IC)](https://www.twi-global.com/innovation-network/centres/innovation-centres/joining-4-0-innovation-centre) at [TWI](https://www.twi-global.com/) and the [National Structural Integrity Research Centre (NSIRC)](https://www.twi-global.com/nsirc) in Cambridge. Additionally, I work part-time as a Software Engineering for Global Product Development at [TWI SEA](https://www.twi-global.com/locations/south-east-asia).

My research interests and expertise encompass various areas of human-robot interaction, robot learning, teleoperation systems, and robot visual servoing. I am focused on enhancing overall robot intelligence and developing next-generation human-robot interactive platforms. My multifaceted involvement in academia and industry positions me at the forefront of technological advancements, and I am passionate about contributing to the future of human robot interaction.

I am actively contributing to the academic community by serving as a reviewer for several international journals and conferences.
